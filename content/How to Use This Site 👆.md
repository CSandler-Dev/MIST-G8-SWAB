This is a Static Site Generated (SSG) website interfacing a relational database of markdown files. The main navigational tool is the Graph View in the upper left hand corner. Notes are mapped in correlation with each other rather than hierarchically.

#### Important Features
- Search
	- This works ==surprisingly well== when searching keywords
	- Sometimes is easier than rummaging through the Graph View
- Explore Our Project
	- This is used to categorize content into buckets but **does not** weave the content together (the "weaving" is done in the Graph View)
- Graph View
	- This is where you can see the notes woven together in terms of their connections with other notes
	- There will be 🏠Page's in each folder from the Explorer that will be the launch point for the note webs

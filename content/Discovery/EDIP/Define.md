> **“University classes should educate more based on skill-based learning rather than focus on memorization and grade based by 2032”**
### 5+ whys 

1. Why do students not gain enough skills compared to the cost?
	1. Because the curriculum may not be aligned with the practical skills needed in the workforce?
2. Why is the curriculum not aligned with the practical skills needed?
	1. Because universities may focus more on theoretical knowledge rather than hands-on experience and industry-relevant training.
3. Why do universities focus more on theoretical knowledge?
	1. Because the academic system prioritizes research, academic theory, and traditional teaching methods, which are easier to assess.
4. Why does the academic system prioritize research and theory over practical skills?
	1. Because the education system is often influenced by long-standing traditions, and there may be insufficient collaboration with industries to understand skill needs.
5. Why is there insufficient collaboration with industries
	1. Because universities and industries might not communicate enough or share goals about how to bridge the gap between education and practical workforce needs.

###### **Defining the CORE Problem:** 
>There is a lack of collaboration between students, UGA, and industries. This results in a curriculum that emphasizes theoretical knowledge and infrequent mistakes over practical, industry-relevant skills and developed problem-solving, which in turn contributes to students not gaining enough skills compared to the cost of their education.

### What is the point of this project?
- SWAB is partnering with MIST G8 to develop, outline, and ultimately plan an EDMS to help us solve the problems of our technically interconnected Event Day
- We hope to be able to create a plan to both solve the problem at hand while also creating real organizational value

### What are we planning on focusing on the most?

- We **REALLY** need a system to ensure our Event Day participants, especially minors, are safe and tracked across the duration of the Event Day

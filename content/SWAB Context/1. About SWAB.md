## People Breakdown
- 22 Exec Board Members (management)
- 150 Internal Members (employees)
- ~1000 Recruited UGA Students p/y (mentors)
- ~500 Invited Athens Students p/y (mentees)
- ~1800 People Attend Event Day p/y
## Operationally, What Do We Do?
- Plan & organize **all** necesicary materials for Event Day
- Facilitate & fundraise all of the money that goes into funding Event Day
- Execute and operate the entirety of Event Day, with hundreds of minors who are our responsibility
	- We have very little margin for error
	- We emphasize safety and documentability
	- We **need** Event Day to consistently run smoothly
- There is a lot more that goes in behind the scene for recruiting, org management, driving growth, etc. but this is the extent of the "overview" we need for the project
## Current Technological Context in SWAB
- In 2024, we introduced a new position called "Director of ITO" which has led to massive tech overhauls
	- We have pivoted with most processes to optimized software and digital workflows to manage our outreach & operations
